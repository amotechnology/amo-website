        <p>
            Amo.Technology was founded in January 2020 by Andrew Mitra ‘21 and Olly Cohen ‘21 with the goal 
            of building a bridge between Wash U computer science and the St. Louis technology industry. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Andrew and Olly launched Developer Student Clubs (DSC) Wash U in August 2019, which currently has 
            over 200 members and 7 projects building solutions for St. Louis nonprofits and businesses. 
        </p>

            Based on their success starting DSC Wash U, Andrew and Olly received a grant to start their 
            consulting group Amo.Technology.
